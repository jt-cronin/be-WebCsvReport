LOGIN works...
	Given pre determined key value pair(login ID and password)
	Want to make sure it is accepted as a true value
	If true value, does it set session ID?

~Need to turn it into a function rather than just floating around in the POST method

Pass the inputted values into the function
The function checks to see if the two data points are equal to the ones we want them to be.
If so, returns true. Else returns false.

SHOW CSV...
	makes sure you have correct privilidges to view reports
	Checks to see if a returned string from CSV is not null

Takes the test data and outputs it into the command line or even just onto a blank html page.
From there, try to see if it can print out each one individually
___________________________________________
Convert for CSV...
	Takes 6 given inputs and puts them into a comma separated format so that it can easily be read back

Grabs the six inputs from the webpage when submit is clicked. Changes the outputs to be uniform with the csv file...
	Account - first letter capitalized
	Date - M/D/YYYY
	Payee - whatever
	Category - first letter capitalized
	Outflow - $##.##
	Inflow - $##.##
Then makes sure that everything is seperated by a comma
